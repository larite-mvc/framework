> **Lightweight. Laravel-Inspired. 100% Custom.**

Larite is a **lightweight PHP MVC framework** inspired by Laravel, but built entirely from scratch. It's designed for developers who love Laravel's syntax and structure but want full control, performance, and simplicity.

Larite is **not a Laravel clone**. It's a fresh micro-framework for small to medium web apps, dashboards, admin panels, and educational projects â€” without Composer bloat or hidden magic.
